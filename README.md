# Wordle

Wordle is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle. It was bought by the New York Times Company in 2022, who has since maintained and published it.
The rules of Wordle are elegantly simple. Your objective is to guess a secret five-letter word in as few guesses as possible.
This repository contains simple python code using a list of english 5-letter words and python random module.

**The file containing the words could have been imported directly to the python file, and there can be many more stuff that could make the code easier and game interesting. This is just one way of doing it!
